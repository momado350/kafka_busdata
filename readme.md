# Kafka BusData Streaming App
In this app we will stream busdata using kafka, the code is writen in Python (pykafka).
The data streamed here is generated from randomly picking latitudes and longitudes of specific bus lines from geojson.io website. in our case we are using Ride KC routes from the city of Kansas City Missouri.
